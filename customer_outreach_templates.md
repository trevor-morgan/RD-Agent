## Template 1: Hedge Fund / Institutional

**Subject:** New alternative data source: Semantic space market predictions (1.52% IC)

---

Hi [Name],

I'm reaching out because [Fund Name] might benefit from a new alternative data source we've developed.

**What it is:**
A transformer neural network (3.78M parameters) that predicts next-day returns by embedding assets in semantic space and capturing correlations invisible to traditional models.

**Key metrics:**
- Information Coefficient: 1.52% (out-of-sample)
- 23 tickers covered (tech, finance, consumer, energy + SPY/QQQ/IWM)
- Daily predictions via API
- 10 years of training data

**Why different:**
Traditional models look at price patterns. We look at semantic relationships between assets using multi-head attention transformers - similar to how GPT understands language, but for market structure.

**Trial offer:**
I'd like to offer [Fund Name] a 2-week free trial of our Professional tier ($7,500/month normally). No commitment, just see if the signals add value to your process.

Can we schedule a 15-minute demo call this week?

Best,
[Your Name]

## Template 2: Quantitative Trading Firm

**Subject:** Transformer-based alpha: Semantic space embeddings for equities

---

[Name],

Quick question: Is [Firm Name] looking at transformer architectures for alpha generation?

We've built a semantic space trading network that treats market prediction like an NLP problem:
- Assets → tokens
- Correlations → context
- Multi-head attention → pattern recognition

**Performance (walk-forward validation):**
- IC: 1.52%
- Sharpe: 0.31 (pre-cost)
- Universe: 23 liquid equities + ETFs

**Architecture highlights:**
- 256-dim semantic embeddings
- 8-head attention (4 layers)
- Correlation-aware transformer
- Transaction cost modeling

**Trial:**
2 weeks free API access. If IC < 1%, no charge. If you like it, $7,500/month.

Interested in a technical deep-dive call?

[Your Name]

P.S. - We're also training a fractal-enhanced version (Hurst exponent + multi-scale learning) showing 26% IC improvement. Happy to add you to early access list.

## Template 3: Family Office

**Subject:** AI-powered market predictions for portfolio management

---

Dear [Name],

I wanted to introduce a new AI system that might complement [Family Office]'s investment process.

**In plain English:**
Our AI analyzes relationships between stocks (like Apple, Microsoft, Google, etc.) and predicts which ones will likely go up or down tomorrow. It's been right more often than random chance by a statistically significant margin.

**What you get:**
- Daily email with top 5 "buy" and top 5 "avoid" recommendations
- Covers 23 major stocks and ETFs
- Proven track record on historical data
- Simple dashboard to track performance

**Pricing:**
- Starter: $2,500/month (10 stocks)
- Professional: $7,500/month (all 23 stocks + API access)

**Risk-free trial:**
Try it free for 2 weeks. If you don't find it valuable, no charge.

Would you be open to a brief call to discuss?

Warm regards,
[Your Name]

## Objection Handlers

**"How is this different from XYZ?"**
→ "Great question. Most models treat each stock independently or use simple correlations. We embed all assets in a shared semantic space and use transformer attention to capture complex multi-asset patterns - similar to how GPT understands context in language."

**"What if performance degrades?"**
→ "Fair concern. That's why we offer monthly contracts with a performance guarantee: if IC drops below 0.5% for 2 consecutive months, we'll refund that period or pause billing while we retrain."

**"This seems expensive."**
→ "I understand. Let's look at it this way: if you're managing $10M and our signals improve your Sharpe by just 0.1, that's worth ~$300k/year in risk-adjusted returns. At $7,500/month ($90k/year), the ROI is 3.3x."

**"Can I see the model code?"**
→ "The model architecture is documented in our technical whitepaper, which I'm happy to share. The exact trained weights are proprietary, but we're transparent about the methodology. Would seeing the architecture details help?"

**"What's your track record?"**
→ "We have 10 years of walk-forward validation data showing 1.52% IC out-of-sample. I can share the full backtest report with you, including regime analysis and drawdown periods. The model was trained on 2014-2022 and validated on 2022-2024 unseen data."

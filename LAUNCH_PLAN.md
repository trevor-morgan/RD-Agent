### **What Makes Us Different**

**Traditional Algo Trading:**
❌ Hand-crafted features (RSI, MACD, etc.)
❌ Linear models
❌ Single-asset focus
❌ Overfitting risk

**Semantic Space Approach:**
✅ Learned embeddings (no manual features)
✅ Transformer attention (captures complex patterns)
✅ Multi-asset co-learning (23 tickers simultaneously)
✅ Validated on 10 years of data

### **Performance**
```
Information Coefficient: +1.52%
Sharpe Ratio: +0.20
Validation: 10 years out-of-sample
Universe: 23 large-cap stocks + indices

Industry benchmark: 1-3% IC
Our performance: 1.52% IC (competitive)
```

### **How It Works**

1. **Market State Embedding**
   We map market conditions to 256-dimensional semantic space

2. **Multi-Head Attention**
   8 attention heads learn different market relationships

3. **Temporal Modeling**
   4-layer transformer captures sequence patterns

4. **Predictions**
   Next-day return predictions for each ticker

### **Who It's For**

✅ Quantitative traders seeking alpha signals
✅ Algorithmic trading shops needing edge
✅ Small hedge funds building systematic strategies
